1)git init// to make ur project a git project,it will create a empty .git folder inside of ur project folder,which may be hidden
2)git status//it shows status that which files are tracked and which are not tracked.so untracked files needed to be add in staging area.
3)git add [filename] || A //files are added in the staging area.
4)git commit -m  "msg" //we will write commit msg after some changes in project,so we will have a work flow of our work,and we can track which things are changed in our project

5)git remote add origin  repoName 
  //-----------------till now our project in on local machine,now we want to host it.we will create a new git repository
  //-----------------above command is used to establish connection between our project which is on local pc and git remote server's repository which we have created.
 

6)git push origin master
 /-----------------/ it will add ur project files to the remote server repository
 //-----------------if u establish connection for the first time then it will ask u about ur github ac email id and password
